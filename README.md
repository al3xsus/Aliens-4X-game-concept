# Aliens-4X-game-concept
This is just some subtle sketch for a possible Aliens-themed 4X game.
Loosely based on Dark Horse Alien-themed comics.

## Quick summary
You're at the head of the joint private-government Earth Defence Committee. Your task is to eliminate xeno danger. You will do it by forming tactical teams (tac teams) to send them into probable infestation areas. You also will have access to research facilities and production sites.

## Plot
Retrofuturistic Earth and its colonies, 22xx year.
Due to navigation error cargo vessel, Odysseus ends up being far away from its ordinary routes. *This part is still in development, but somehow they found the eggs, someone gets impregnated, then Alien movie plot is repeating, but with one small difference - when the last member of the crew is found alive, he is being facehugger'd*. Company BioNaTech takes the impregnated and has their own alien in their secret lab somewhere in the jungles of South America. Xeno mutates into the queen and starts making eggs. Unfortunately, the queen is a powerful telepath, since it's a common way for her to communicate with all other kinds of xenomorphes. Her powers make many susceptible people see recurring nightmares about horrible alien creatures. That phenomenon with pretty much the same visions among completely different people attracts the attention of academics and officials. Some of them, who had a bit of knowledge about aliens, start sounding the alarm. Besides, those waves of psycho energy have a strong influence over some weak-willed minds and the one already psychologically unstable person starts the cult of the xeno. They grow bigger and bigger and someday they find the location of the queen. They made it inside - some of them get impregnated, some steal fertile eggs. Despite the security efforts and fail-safe device, that detonate the nuclear bomb under the lab in 90 seconds after the perimeter breach, some of the cultists made it out alive (for now). Race with time began.

## Features and visuals
The main screen is kind of akin to XCOM - holographical Earth, Moon, and space stations nearby.
