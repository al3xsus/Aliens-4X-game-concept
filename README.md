# Aliens-4X-game-concept
This is just some subtle sketch for a possible Aliens-themed 4X game.
Loosely based on Dark Horse Alien-themed comics.

## Quick summary
You're at the head of the joint private-government Earth Defence Committee. Your task is to eliminate Xeno infestation. You will do it by forming tactical teams (tac teams) to send them into probable infestation areas. For the overall success of the operation, you'll also need to scout (gather all useful info), research (captured species, materials, probes, body parts), investigate and produce (specialized weapons, ammo, armor, transport, and so on). 

## Plot
Retrofuturistic Earth and its colonies, 22xx year.
Due to a navigation error cargo vessel, Odysseus ends up being far away from its ordinary routes. *This part is still in development, but somehow they found the eggs, someone gets impregnated, then the Alien movie plot is repeating, but with one small difference - when the last member of the crew is found alive, he is being facehugger'd*. Company BioTech takes the impregnated and has their own alien in their secret lab somewhere in the jungles of South America. Xeno mutates into the queen and starts making eggs. Unfortunately, the queen is a powerful telepath, since it's a common way for her to communicate with all other kinds of xenomorphs. Her powers make many susceptible people see recurring nightmares about horrible alien creatures. That phenomenon with pretty much the same visions among completely different people attracts the attention of academics and officials. Some of them, who had a bit of knowledge about aliens, start sounding the alarm. But the most horrible thing is that those waves of psycho energy have a strong influence over some weak-willed minds and the one already psychologically unstable person starts the cult of the Xeno. They grow bigger and bigger and someday they find the location of the queen. They made it inside - some of them get impregnated, some steal fertile eggs. Despite the security efforts and fail-safe device, that detonate the nuclear bomb under the lab 90 seconds after the perimeter breach, some of the cultists made it out alive (for now). *This part is in development, but now both government and private mega corporations are united against the alien menace*. Race with time began.

## A few words about your opponent(s)
On their side, there are numbers, time, and determination.
You need at least 18 years for human to become more or less useful.
It's just a couple of weeks in the worst case for your opponent to grow into a full-scale nightmarish creature - drone or queen.
They are able to reproduce not only with humans, but also with almost any large animal, domesticated or not, effectively not only enlarging their forces but also cutting off your food supply.
And those hordes have no pity, remorse, or fear. If there would be a need for a thousand drones to die to save one egg - it would be done. They are perfect Darwinian organisms, the biomechanical top of the food chain. There is almost no place on Earth unsuitable for them - no matter, if it is a scientifical megapolis of Antarctic-city or overcrowded and dusty New Cairo, a calm fisherman village on Chile's shore, or a vivid Tokyo Metropolis.
But there is more - their appearance, their lifecycle, and the whole fact of their existence would be a great demoralizing factor for people on all levels of power - from ordinary civilians to military and officials. And don't forget about their psychoactivity. All of those means worse and worse situation for humans as aliens advance. Coups, uprisings, rebellions, terrorism will be on the rise. High possibility of new Xeno cults.
Apart from cultists, rogue military, and various terrorists, there is also uncertainty in your relationships with corporations and governments. Some of them would not like to participate. Some of them could even have their own biolabs with a living nightmare.

## A few words about you
On your side, there are science, technology, and human genius.
Despite the fact, that queens are smartest than the ordinary person, drones are less than capable. A squad of barely-trained conscripts with automatic weapons are able to destroy the same amount of drones without that many casualties, it's only a matter of discipline. A squad of conscripts and combat vehicle highly increases the victory chances. A modern military with fire support, artillery, and drone strikes will lessen the chances for xenos to survive as little as possible.
Apart from it, there are always probabilities, that situation is gonna change in your favor.
Some of the cultists will be so terrified, when they would've seen their god in flesh, they would immediately leave the cult. Some of them would even come to you and be ready for collaboration. However, it's up to you. You can take them or execute them as terrorists.
Besides, not all xeno cults would be centered around worshipping the Xenomorph or Queen. Part of those cults would be about killing them.

## A few words about the game.
In the beginning, you only need to hunt for a couple of dozens of cultists, tracking down every possible carrier. You need to make it hush-hush, no one needs to know about the alien danger. There are not so many nests at all, sometimes it would be just an alone drone. A little group of special forces will take care of them. Unfortunately, the members of a deadly cult spread out all across the globe. 
You would have to gather all info and choose what possible cases to investigate. Sometimes you'll be right and you will kill the future problem. Sometimes it's gonna be just a rumor, and you'll spend time and resources on futile.
First proper nest is gonna be a big problem. You'll need more special weapons, more special armor, more trained personnel. Some of your people would become veterans and very skilled bug hunters. Some of them will go AWOL. Some will become casualties.
*This part in development*

## Features and visuals
The main screen is kind of akin to XCOM - holographical Earth, Moon, and space stations nearby.
